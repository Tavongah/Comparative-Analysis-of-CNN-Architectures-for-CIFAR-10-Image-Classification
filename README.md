🎯 CIFAR-10 CNN Comparison Project


📋 Project Overview

This project implements and compares three distinct Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures for image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Through systematic experimentation and analysis, we investigate how different architectural choices impact classification performance, generalization ability, and training efficiency.

🔍 Research Question

*What CNN architecture provides the optimal balance of accuracy, efficiency, and generalization for CIFAR-10 image classification?*

📊 Results Summary

Model	Test Accuracy	Key Features	Performance Insight
Deeper CNN 🥇	77.62%	Batch Normalization, Global Avg Pooling, 3 Conv Blocks	Highest accuracy, best generalization
Baseline CNN 🥈	77.02%	Simple 2-block architecture, dropout	Surprisingly effective, fastest training
CNN with Augmentation 🥉	71.10%	Built-in data augmentation, extra conv layer	Needs careful tuning, generalization focus

💡 Key Insights

✅ What Worked Well

Simple is effective: Baseline CNN achieved 77.02% with minimal complexity

Depth helps moderately: +0.6% improvement with deeper architecture

Batch normalization: Enables stable training of deeper networks

Global Average Pooling: Parameter-efficient alternative to flattening

⚠️ Challenges & Learnings

Data augmentation requires care: Aggressive augmentation hurt performance

Diminishing returns: Depth improvements were marginal on CIFAR-10

Validation-test gap: Some models generalized better than others

Animal classification hardest: Semantic similarity causes confusion
